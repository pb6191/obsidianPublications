controlling for b0

where b0 = initial engage/dwell
b1 = rate of change of engage/dwell
DVs = importance and newsworthiness

Monkeypox:

initial engagement (not dwell) directly proportional to imp/newsworthiness: ppl who engage more initially consider monkeypox to be more important/newsworthy

ppl who are low on engagement/b0 to begin with, show steeper declines (-ve marginal effect/slope of b1 on DVs) in imp/newsworthiness as they engage further, as compared to ppl who engage more initially:

Climate change:

initial engagement (not dwell) directly proportional to imp/newsworthiness: ppl who engage more initially consider climate change to be more important/newsworthy

Interaction of engagement b0 and b1 is not significant for will smith. Interaction of dwell b0 and b1 is not significant for any of the 3 focal news
